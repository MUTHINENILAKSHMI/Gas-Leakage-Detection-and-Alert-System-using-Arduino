# Gas Leakage Detection and Alert System using Arduino

This project detects gas leakage and provides real-time alerts using Arduino and an MQ gas sensor.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- MQ-2 Gas Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Buzzer
- Red & Green LEDs
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Working Principle
The MQ gas sensor continuously monitors gas concentration.  
When the gas level exceeds a predefined threshold:
- Red LED turns ON
- Buzzer activates
- Warning message is displayed on LCD

If gas levels are normal:
- Green LED remains ON
- System stays in safe mode

## Simulation
The project is simulated using Tinkercad.
